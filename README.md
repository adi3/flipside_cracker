# Flipside Cracker

An extension for Google Chrome that solves the weekly challenges released by The Stanford Flipside (TSF) with the click of a button!

## Notes

+ Simply install the extension in your Chrome browser, navigate to any challenge listed on TSF's [puzzle page](http://stanfordflipside.com/category/puzzles/) and click the extension button. Solutions will immediately show up under the puzzles.

+ If you're thinking of using this extension to win the shot glasses given out by TSF, forget the idea :) I've set up scripts that automatically probe TSF's site and fill out the puzzles as soon as they are released. ~~Muahahah, all shot glasses mine!~~ UPDATE: TSF put in an arbitrary rule: *You cannot win the shot glass more than once.* Well, fuck.

+ If you're part of TSF and want to fix the security vunerability which enables this extension to work, contact me.
